Greetings! My name is Alan Ding, and I'm a student by trade. Currently, I happen to study computer science at Princeton University. Given that I'm not grinding out problem sets and coding assignments, with p > 0.9, I'm running, doing something related to classical or jazz music, or speedsolving twisty puzzles.
